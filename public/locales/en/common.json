  "storyTitle1": "What is Lorem Ipsum?",
  "story1": "Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.",
  "storyTitle2": "Where does it come from?",
  "story2": "Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of 'de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum' (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..', comes from a line in section 1.10.32.",
  "roadmapTitle1": "1. Prepare Ingredients",
  "roadmap1": "Allow the butter and eggs to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. This will make the butter easier to blend. Room temperature eggs allow more air to be incorporated into your batter for a lighter texture. Grease and flour twelve 2½-inch muffin cups or line with paper baking cups (Target); set aside.",
  "roadmapTitle2": "2. Combine Butter and Sugar",
  "roadmap2": "Many cupcake recipes call for beating the butter and sugar together for 1 minute, using a hand mixer $34.99 (Bed Bath & Beyond) or stand mixer. This is called creaming, and it creates little pockets of air in the mixture, resulting in light and fluffy cupcakes. Just be sure not to overbeat the mixture. You can tell you've gone too far if the butter starts to separate.",
  "roadmapTitle3": "3. Add Eggs and Vanilla",
  "roadmap3": "After creaming the butter and sugar, most cupcake recipes next call for adding the eggs. Depending on the recipe, you may add whole eggs, just egg yolks, or just egg whites. Some recipes include other ingredients to add along with the eggs, such as vanilla or other flavorings.",
  "roadmapTitle4": "4. Alternate Adding Dry and Wet Ingredients",
  "roadmap4": "In a separate mixing bowl (Crate & Barrel), stir together the dry ingredients, such as flour, salt, and baking powder. Most cupcake recipes call for alternately adding the dry ingredients and the wet ingredients (like milk or cream), beating between each addition. Don't be tempted to add everything at once. Adding all of the wet ingredients at once can cause the batter to separate, resulting in a heavy cake. Adding all of the dry ingredients at once can make the batter too thick, which can lead to overmixing.",
  "roadmapTitle5": "5. Fill the Cupcake Liners",
  "roadmap5": "Wondering how much batter to use per cupcake? For standard 2½-inch cupcakes, fill cupcake liners with ¼ cup batter to about ⅔ to ¾ of the way full. Avoid adding too much batter, or the cupcakes will overflow the cups as they bake and cause a mess. Here are some easy ways to fill cupcake liners with cupcake batter",
  "roadmapTitle6": "6. Bake and Cool Cupcakes",
  "roadmap6": "For chocolate, vanilla, and most other cupcake recipes, you'll want to bake for 15 to 20 minutes in an oven preheated to 350°F. Test for doneness by inserting a wooden toothpick into the center a cupcake. If the toothpick is clean when you remove it, the cupcakes are done. If wet batter or several moist crumbs cling to the toothpick, they need to bake longer. Cool the cupcakes for 5 minutes in the pan before moving them to a wire rack to cool completely.",
  "roadmapTitle7": "7. Frost and Decorate",
  "roadmap7": "For the prettiest cupcakes, start with decorative liners. It's the easiest way to spruce them up for special occasions. From there, use a piping bag (Michaels) to decorate your cupcakes. If you don't have piping bags, use a resealable plastic bag with the end snipped off, or simply spread with a knife. Use our customizable buttercream frosting recipe (with seven flavor variations) to get started. For an unforgettable dessert, feel free to go wild with holiday toppings, sprinkles, nuts, or whatever your heart desires."
